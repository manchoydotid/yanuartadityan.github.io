I'm writing this post in a cloudy Sunday morning, September 18th, in my favorite breakfast table inside my apartment. Mood is normal and everything seems to be awesome today.

It has been 2 years since I've started my life as (again) student here in lovely Göteborg. I did study much, play harder than ever before, explore so called nature even more than prior chapters of my life. But, I didn't write that much though, I just don't have the feeling to write anything. I had this kind of intention to regularly writing the day passed in this blog, but well yeah, not even close. Too much time invested on something else than writing which I like to achieve more. Achieve? Something silly when I haven't achieved something lately, until this last month...

Let's go flashback 8 months ago. I was granted an opportunity to work with Volvo Cars for my academic thesis. It is funded, lots of experiences await and (obviously) an exposure to the one of the Swedish pride, a Volvo.
While it seems fine and fit within some kind of long term plan of mine, I felt like I didn't possess sufficient knowledge to be involved within the project, but alas, I finished the thesis and presented on fourth week of August. Then I was offered a permanent position within the company, working together with awesome people, in an awesome company full of OCD people about *Active Safety*, of course in a positive way. Now, I am writing this post right after I read something from the news, about Mr. Sebastian Thrun. If you don't know him, he is the founding father of Udacity and ex-director of Google Self Driving Car which just made a statement that [self driving car engineers worth $10M][01] and industries are running out of this kind of engineers. They need plenty of people to work with and I was like HOLY F**K! Now, I'm in between being confused, happy, anxiety and also vigilant as crazy as you can imagine. Why? Because I didn't foresee this and now there's someone open a statement about a big opportunity waits ahead.

**TL;DR** I never really capable of answering questions about what do I always want with this life. Now, I do know the answer. I want to be an engineer worth $10M. It gives hope to me and hopefully more people to come. I am in this state not because I foresaw this chance, I just followed the path in front of me and taking the turn just because I like to do with it. Opportunity does exist in any path to your dreams. But, it's not gonna be your dream if you don't like things you'll encounter along the path.
