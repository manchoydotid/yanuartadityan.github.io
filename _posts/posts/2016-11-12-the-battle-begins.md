**Waiting is Hard**

No one can deny that waiting is maybe the less favorable activity amongst plenty. Waiting in a line in public facilities, waiting your friends, your food order, your favorite's serial next episode, next release of Apple product and much more. But, there's one that I would deem to be equally hard or even harder. Waiting for someone else's decision that affects your life. It's like someone is holding the key to the gate which hinder you to go through. Stick with me.

**June 2016**

I was finishing my thesis and legally I could stay in Sweden 'til end of June. Everyone else seems to had have their thesis presented during the first 2 weeks and gladly applying for mere 6 months extra stay. What would this period means for us? Prolonging a hope to potentially get a job or further education, e.g. PhD. My girlfriend succesfully got her extension and for me, I applied for different stay, extra 3 months of a sudden death tic-toc time. Not a hope, but rather a final warning to get the thesis done before the end of August.

**July 2016**

Life is like a roller coaster, sometimes up and sometimes down. July was quite a joy for me with sun showering rays and people seems so positive during this time. I got a call from the boss and he suggested me to challenge myself. What kind of challenge other than facing him in an one-on-one technical interview. What for? For a potential full time employment he said. Only if I was interested. I said no, I mean yes, no but yes, oh my, YES, YES sir please. I went through an interview and last day before the everlong summer holiday, he called me and interested to put me in his team.

No news from him until end of August. Waiting...

**August 2016**

This is one of the worst month of all. My girlfriend got an intern somewhere in Berkeley, CA, and preparing to leave Sweden for good. I couldn't really support her with lot of free time. After all, 3 supervisors were just having fun sending me revisions by revisions. What kind of holiday they had? So, not enough time for my girl and I was pushed to the limit.

One revision sent, and waiting period began. Got another two's.

One further revision sent. Got another three's. Waiting is my middle name...

**September 2016**

Finished everything finally. Got a good solid feedbacks from all of the guys behind. While at the time, got a call from Indonesia. My mom is having a problem with her lungs and my plan to invite her all the way to Gothenburg was cancelled. I need to go home, I need to visit her.

One can leave Sweden and can't go back without any VISA. Waiting for 'already 3.5 months' VISA extension process...

**October 2016**

And here it comes, the October. It was a month of an illegal stay in Sweden here I tell you. I could leave Sweden to go home, but I couldn't enter Sweden. But Allah is the Great. Allah is the One Who Knows Everything. His plan on me during October subdued me with tranquility. Done with the study and got my final academic transcript (FINALLY!). My mom was getting new chemo pills and her body seemed to accept it pretty well. But still, I would like to meet her and spend times and telling her all my stories during the last 1.5 years. Yet still, I couldn't go anywhere else and I was just being me. I played Dota 2 prolifically to set the highest record of playing time during the last 2 years. I admit it as a lame achievement, but I like it. Hell yeah. Then, the boss gave me a call and asked me to apply for the official job ads after 3 months.

Interview phase. Waiting. Written test. Waiting. Another interview. Waiting. Another technical interview. Waiting...

**November 2016**

Best of the best. I got both the fruits: 6 months extra stay and a piece of paper from the last test of the employment, a drug-test result form...
The longer you wait, the bigger amount of uncertainty is introduced. In the end, a huge amount of surprise will follow a turnaround ending. In this story, a sweet ending it is. But I just couldn't smile since I know the battle has just started, both for me, my mom and everyone else.
