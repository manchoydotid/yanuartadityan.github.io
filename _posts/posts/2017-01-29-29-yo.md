### I am 29 years old 

As a person who was born in January, perhaps new year solution is still in the air. But I didn't really think that way. Not even once, because I'm bad at planning. I do care less on planning and perhaps will still be like this forever. Some people say seems to care about that though. Keep makes me uncomfy.

### What's next?
Finishing my master thesis was considered to be the light at the end of the tunnel. I did it, and I am happy to have my name now a lil bit longer. But it's not over yet, new chapter has arrived and much harder. Much much harder.

### Enduring
I would prefer to call it, fresh start and adaptation. A cycle anyone will eventually has to go through everytime a new chapter comes.
